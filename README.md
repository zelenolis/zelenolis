### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>I'm Eugene Sukhanov, junior front-end developer.</p>

<p>I'm a passionate front-end developer with a love for coding and a creative side. Photography and design are not just my hobbies; they're my inspirations. My technical toolbox includes JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and I'm well-versed in both Less/Sass and TypeScript. Currently, I'm on a journey of continuous learning, delving into the world of Angular to expand my skills and create even more engaging web experiences.</p>
